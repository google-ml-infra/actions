# This is a critical workaround for a known issue with protovalidate and its
# package structure. The code generated by protoc expects to be able to
# import buf.validate, but the standard protovalidate package on PyPI
# does not provide buf as a top-level module.
# This separate package, provided by Buf's own registry, is structured correctly
# and provides the missing buf module, which solves the ModuleNotFoundError.
# We are waiting for a fix to be merged that will make this a subpackage of
# the main protovalidate library, at which point this dependency can be removed.
# See: https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-python/pull/367

    # This is a critical workaround for a known issue with protovalidate and its
    # package structure. The code generated by protoc expects to be able to
    # import buf.validate, but the standard protovalidate package on PyPI
    # does not provide buf as a top-level module.
    # This separate package, provided by Buf's own registry, is structured correctly
    # and provides the missing buf module, which solves the ModuleNotFoundError.
    # We are waiting for a fix to be merged that will make this a subpackage of
    # the main protovalidate library, at which point this dependency can be removed.
